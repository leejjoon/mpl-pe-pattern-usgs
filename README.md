# mpl-pe-pattern-usgs

A package to draw USGS patterns for Matplotlib. The svg files from
[svgpatternusgs](https://github.com/coolbutuseless/svgpatternusgs), which are
originally from
[geologic-patterns](https://github.com/davenquinn/geologic-patterns), are
processed with [picosvg](https://github.com/googlefonts/picosvg) and converted
to matplotlib's paths.
